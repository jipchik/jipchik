Howdy, I just want to provide some context for the private status on my projects for folks reviewing my github profile. 

The majority of the projects I have on my profile have been school projects, therefore, they are going to be private out of respect for my professors/fellow students. 
However, I will happily alter the visibility of any project requested during an interview process with your company!! 

As I grow my profile, I will of course have public projects to display other skills I am leveling up in. 

Happy Hunting, 

Jack
